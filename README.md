# Rubik's Cube Solving Program

Preparatory work for the experiment of the course Design of Electronic Systems.

This program can solve the Rubik's cube by the traditional formula method. The tests shows that using a quad-core 2.7GHz computer and Visual Studio compilation, the C function clock() cannot measure the time required to obtain the result (i.e., it is less than 1 ms).
